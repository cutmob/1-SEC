# Contributing to 1-SEC

Thanks for your interest in 1-SEC! We appreciate the enthusiasm.

## Contribution Policy

**1-SEC does not accept external code contributions (pull requests) at this time.**

This is a deliberate choice to maintain licensing clarity under our dual-license model (AGPLv3 + Commercial). Accepting outside code would complicate our ability to offer commercial licenses, since we'd need copyright assignment or a CLA for every contribution.

## How You Can Help

Even though we don't accept PRs, there are other ways to support the project:

- **Report bugs** — [Open an issue](https://github.com/cutmob/1-SEC/issues/new). We read every one.
- **Request features** — Issues are the right place for feature ideas too.
- **Share feedback** — Tell us what's working and what isn't.
- **Spread the word** — Star the repo, share it with your team, write about it.

## Why No External Contributions?

1-SEC is dual-licensed: the open-source version is AGPLv3, and we offer a separate commercial license for organizations that need it. To maintain the ability to offer both licenses, we need to hold copyright over the entire codebase. Accepting external contributions without a CLA would make this legally complicated.

We may revisit this policy in the future. For now, issues and feedback are the best way to contribute.

## Security Vulnerabilities
